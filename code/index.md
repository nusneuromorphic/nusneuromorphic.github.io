We often publically release the code developed in-house. 
Below are a list of such codes released for public use, their short description and their link.

##SOFEA: A Non-iterative and Robust Optical Flow Estimation Algorithm for Dynamic Vision Sensors ##
>__Repository link__: [https://bitbucket.org/wengfei_nus/sofea/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/wengfei_nus/sofea/src/master/)
>
>This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Single-shot Optical Flow Estimation Algorithm (SOFEA),
>as presented in the CVPR 2020 workshop paper "SOFEA: A Non-iterative and Robust Optical Flow Estimation Algorithm for Dynamic Vision". 

## DART: Distribution Aware Retinal Transform ##
>__Repository link__: [Source code (with tracking annotations)](https://goo.gl/cVNWLB)
>
>DART is an event-based feature descriptor for silicon retinas.
>The source code is also part of the submission to a journal, available publicly on [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10800). 
>The DART descriptor has been applied to four different problems, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature matching.

## SLAYER : Spike LAYer Error Reassignment ##
>__Repository link__: [https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/slayer](https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/slayer)
>
>SLAYER is an effective backpropagation algorithm for Deep Spiking Neural Networks.
>This repo is the SLAYER framework implementation that utilizes GPU parallel execution and 
>can be used to train your Spiking Neural Networks on your own data.

## SLAYER PyTorch ##
>__Repository link__: [https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch](https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch)
>
>This is PyTorch port of SLAYER algorithm for Deep Spiking Neural Networks. Some of the features are still in development.

## Spike Files Read Write ##
>__Repository link__: [https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/spikefilesreadwrite](https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/spikefilesreadwrite)
>
>This repository contains `MATLAB` scripts to read and write spike data into address event encoded binary format.
>The binary files are compatible to use with [SLAYER](#slayer:-spike-layer-error-reassignment).

## MATLAB AER Vision Functions ##
>__Repository link__: [https://github.com/gorchard/Matlab_AER_vision_functions](https://github.com/gorchard/Matlab_AER_vision_functions)
>
>This repository contains some commonly used `MATLAB` functions for working with and displaying AER vision data.

## Neuromorphic Datasets ##
>__Link:__: [https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets)
>
> These are neuromorphic vision datasets captured using DVS sensor: __N-MNIST__, __N-Caltech101__, __Characters__.
