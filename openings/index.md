We have several openings available at
[Temasek Laboratories](http://www.temasek-labs.nus.edu.sg/)
and the Singapore Institute of Neurotechnology (SINAPSE).

At __Temasek laboratories__,
>you will work in the field of neuromorphic engineering, especially from an algorithmic prespective,
>in an ongoing collaboration with __A*STAR__(Agency for Science, Technology and Research) on their efficient neuromorphic computing program.
>In addition, you will have an oppertunity to work on cutting edge neuromorphic processors such as IBM's __TrueNorth__ and Intel's __Loihi__.
>
>Contact: Sumit Bam Shrestha (tslsbs (AT) nus (DOT) edu (DOT) sg)

At __SINAPSE__,
>you will work in neuromorphic vision, object recognition and tracking for low power system application
>including sensor integration and FPGA deployment. 
>You will predominantly work on event-based camera sensors, which are low power image sensors with high temporal resolution, high dynamic range aynchronous signal output.
>
