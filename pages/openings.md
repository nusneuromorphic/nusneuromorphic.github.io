We have several openings available at the [N.1 Institute](https://n1labs.org/), where

>you will work in collaboration with NTU (Nanyang Technological University) on neuromorphic vision, object recognition and tracking for low power applications,
>including work on cutting edge neuromorphic processors, spiking neural networks and FPGA deployment. 
>You will predominantly work on event-based camera sensors, which are low power image sensors with high temporal resolution, high dynamic range aynchronous signal output.
