We often publically release the code developed in-house. 
Below are a list of short description and link to the repositories.

## SLAYER : Spike LAYer Error Reassignment ##
__Repository link__: [https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/slayer](https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/slayer)

SLAYER is an effective backpropagation algorithm for Deep Spiking Neural Networks.
This repo is the SLAYER framework implementation that utilizes GPU parallel execution and 
can be used to train your Spiking Neural Networks on your own data.

## Spike Files Read Write ##
__Repository link__: [https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/spikefilesreadwrite](https://bitbucket.org/bamsumit/spikefilesreadwrite)

This repository contains `MATLAB` scripts to read and write spike data into address event encoded binary format.
The binary files are compatible to use with [SLAYER](#slayer:-spike-layer-error-reassignment).
This repository also contains scripts to read data from jAER files from event based vision sensors.
