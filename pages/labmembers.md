<h1>Bharath Ramesh, Research scientist</h1>

<img src="/images/Lab_pics/Bharath.jpg" width="200" alt="Bharath picture" class="float-img"/>

<p style="text-align:justify">Bharath’s main research interests include pattern recognition and computer vision. At present, his research is centered on event-based cameras for autonomous robot navigation. This includes localization and mapping with an array of sensors, most importantly event-based cameras, to be processed efficiently to yield accurate results at real-time. In the past, he has mostly worked on object recognition and related areas such as scene understanding, face recognition, and object detection. He received the B.E. degree in electrical & electronics engineering from Anna University of India in 2009; M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National University of Singapore in 2011 and 2015 respectively, working at the Control and Simulation Laboratory on Image Classification using Invariant Features. <br>

<h1>Fabien Colonnier, Research Scientist</h1>

<img src="/images/Lab_pics/Fabien.jpg" width="200" alt="Fabien picture" class="float-img"/>
<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">Fabien received his MSc in automotive engineering with a speciality on embedded systems from the ESTACA engineering school in 2012 and his PhD degree in bio-robotics from the Aix-Marseille University in 2017, both in France. He was early interested in autonomous vehicles and robots. An opportunity to work on bio-inspired vision attracted him. His research on the fly’s compound eyes made him realized how impressive these insects are (he does not swat them anymore, except mosquitos which are really annoying!). His current research interests include bio-inspired vision, event-based camera, computer vision and their applications to aerial and ground vehicles.</p>
