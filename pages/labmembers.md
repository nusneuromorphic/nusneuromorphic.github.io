<h1>Bharath Ramesh, Senior Research Fellow</h1>

<img src="/images/Lab_pics/Bharath.jpg" width="200" alt="Bharath picture" class="float-img"/>

<p style="text-align:justify">
	Bharath's main research interests include pattern recognition and computer vision. 
	At present, his research is centered on event-based cameras for autonomous sensing and navigation. 
	This includes tracking and recognition with an array of sensors, most importantly event-based cameras, 
	to be processed efficiently on low-power devices to yield accurate results at real-time. 
	In the past, he has mostly worked on object recognition and related areas such as scene understanding, 
	face recognition, and object detection. 
	He received the B.E. degree in electrical & electronics engineering from Anna University of India in 2009; 
	M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National University of Singapore in 2011 and 2015 respectively, 
	working at the Control and Simulation Laboratory on Image Classification using Invariant Features.
